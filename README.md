This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

I used Tailwind.CSS in the design of this project, which I wrote with Next.js. As a database, the data comes from MongoDB. The data contained in the student-datas.json file inside the files is created by creating an account in MongoDB with the Thunder Client extension and using GET and POST methods. you can send and store it to your database and then start the project and view it in the browser. You can also delete the desired data from the database using the DELETE method, and add new student data to the database using the UPDATE method.
Thanks.

## Deploy on Vercel
